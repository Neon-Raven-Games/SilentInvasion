VR horror game, finished all the level design/environment. Rough around the edges, never to be finished

Yeah, not sure if i am going to make it much longer, so figured i should prolly start time capsuling. 
**True artists are never appreciated in their time**
My stalker wanted me to finish this game because references to her were in it. 
Exactly why I am not finishing it. 
None of the pieces of shit it references deserve a second of spotlight.
Feel free to check it out.

This was a tribute to my shitty parents who are in organized crime and actively trying to harm me, hid things from me as a child, and I have been coached since infancy.
Parents did me wrong my whole life, had skeletons I dug up, and was on the run from someone actively trying to kill me. I lived with them for a few months.
My father frequently had liners like "Shut up or I'll knock your teeth down your throat", or that he was going to call DIFUS to take me away (some child wellfare thing in NJ)
Not to mention he was absurdly racist. The whole reason I want to save the world is because I want to be the opposite of that man.

**Levels**
* *Anne Frank*
The first level is a reference to my first childhood memory (very young) where I was hid behind a wall in hopactong, NJ where I was told if I wasn't silent "the government would get me"
* *The factory/warehouse*
part was a tribute to my time at caterpillar inc, and how amature/conforming everyone there was. They tried to under pay me and stuff me in a box. was not gonna happen. The puzzle is to break the rules, take the block to the entrance even tho the alarm is blaring

* *Mental Prison*
The symbology for living with this scum bag for months, after my Ex pushed me out of my home and stole my kids. I wound up moving in with someone just as bad afterwards tho. He threatened to kill me which prompted a runaway where I was chased into the next level.

* *The Woods*
Represented the running constantly from one edge of the map to the other, never feeling okay or like my life wasn't hunted. like I wasn't prey.

* *Alexis Hotel*
His ex (sorry i was mr. steal yo girl, but she took advantage of me), stalked me and actually put me in jail on false charges. Waited for me to get out and chased me down the street. 
But before this, we were together, running away after he threatened to kill me and she was telling me about a time where she helped him dump murder evidence late at night before I ever got there.
So as we ran away, he treated her really bad, so I tried to be as supportive as possible and picked the alexis hotel in dallas tx as a place we went to shortly after running.
This is where I was living when I made the **Horror Thesis** game, in the Alexis Hotel, running from a murderer who was stalking us, and our friends/family. it was a contract where i finished someone's master's thesis in like a week on the run from a killer, door dashing to make the money to stay in a hotel after being pushed out of my home and across the country.
This is also why I am refusing to finish the game. Those pieces of shit don't deserve the glory of the off chance it became successful. Not my parents, not dan, not alexis.

* *The Motel*
This is where I spent X-mas, before i found out my father likely sexually abused my children, and the DSS/CPS burried everything about it. There's a couple places where you pick up the phone and it says 911 won't help you here, eyes on the walls and shit.
The Gaston County DSS and CPS have burried every part of the case, but to protect my children's privacy, i won't go too into details. But just know they are with an abuser right now, and they are actively harming me.

* The Exit
Never finished, but was going to collapse the walls, and a heart in the middle of a cavity, where you have to pull the artieries out and blood flies everywhere and the heart freezes over
A gf i was dating but broke up with during that whole crazy shit went silent on me and pulled the plug destroying my heart. we eventually reconnected, but then flipped out on me and insulted me a lot, criticizing my actions so i blocked her.
